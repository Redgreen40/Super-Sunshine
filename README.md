## About

This ray-tracer was written as a final project for Ravi Ramamoorthi's fantastic [course](https://www.edx.org/course/computer-graphics-uc-san-diegox-cse167x-2) on computer graphics. It was built from scratch with a strong focus on making the C++ code clear and organized.

The only external library used is the [FreeImage Library](https://www.edx.org/course/computer-graphics-uc-san-diegox-cse167x-2).

## Description
