# Ray-Tracer

A recursive ray-tracer with a built-in scene parser for easily generating beautiful images.

## Description

When I started working on this project, I thought the most challenging aspect of it would be to translate all the theory behind a ray-tracer into well-written code. Once I finished it, however, I found that using a ray-tracer is a lot more challenging that actually implementing one!
